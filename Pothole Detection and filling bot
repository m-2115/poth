This is a record of the project work carried out by us, during the year **2024-2025** as part of **INDUCTION** under the guidance and supervision of **Mr. Aarushraj Puduchery & Mr. G. Kovidh Addhish** (Technical Heads) and **Mr. N V V S Narayana** (The President of THE ROBOTICS CLUB)

## Abstract

## Introduction

## Problem Statement
**Revolutionizing Pothole Management**
Potholes, worsened by heavy rains, pose hazards to motorists and pedestrians, causing accidents, vehicle damage, and infrastructure issues. 
Traditional pothole detection and repair methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and rely on conventional materials like asphalt, which can be resource-constrained and environmentally unfriendly. 
These methods result in prolonged road closures, traffic delays, and high maintenance costs.
A revolutionary approach using advanced technology, sustainable materials, and streamlined processes is crucial. This ensures safer roads, reduces environmental impact, and optimizes resource use.
